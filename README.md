# JAVA MineSweeper-CL
===
This is made open source.

---

The reason to write this programme is because my younger brother is having a programming assignment on writing a minesweeper game in PASCAL. Although my brother knows coding at that time, he barely understand the implementation of minesweeper logic. Given that Java is the only programming language I know at that time, I write this Java programme to illustrate the implementation of minesweeper logic in code. Another major reason is to test my Java skills, as by the time I write this programme, It is just 2 months since I learn programming at year 2 of my university studies. I am glad that I can write and debug this programme within 6 hours
